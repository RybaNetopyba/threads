## On the History of the Traditional Folk Costume of Sloboda Ukraine

***Slobozhanshchyna***, or ***Sloboda Ukraine***, is an ethnographic region bordered to the north by Novhorod-Siversky Polissia, to the west by Poltava, and to the southwest by the Lower Dnipro region, Pryazovia, and Tavria. In addition to Kharkiv Oblast, the region includes southwestern districts of Sumy Oblast, northern parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and within modern Russia, the southern districts of Voronezh and Kursk, as well as nearly all of Belgorod Oblast.

Despite periodic waves of interest in material folk culture throughout the 20th century and beyond, the study of the traditional costume of Sloboda Ukraine has long remained on the periphery of modern ethnography, garnering attention mostly in passing. One key reason is the low degree of preservation of traditional clothing practices in this region, which began to deteriorate rapidly at the end of the 19th century. Furthermore, social upheavals such as collectivization, the Holodomor, and the tragic events of World War II led to the physical destruction of many examples of folk art.

Efforts to fill this gap on the ethnographic map of Ukraine have varied in approach and success. Some researchers have tended to equate Sloboda Ukrainian costumes with the better-preserved and studied Poltava costumes. While neighboring regional traditions do share many similarities, they cannot be considered identical. Early but significant attempts to highlight the unique features of Sloboda Ukrainian attire date back to the late 19th century. These efforts coincided with the flourishing of regional ethnography, notably in preparation for the 12th Archaeological Congress held in Kharkiv in 1902, a landmark event for the city’s intellectual community.

The exhibition held as part of the congress drew particular attention, attracting an estimated 57,000 visitors in a short time. The ethnographic section, the richest part of the exhibition, featured items of folk life collected from Katerynoslav, Poltava, Kharkiv, Voronezh, Kursk, and Chernihiv provinces, with traditional clothing, footwear, and jewelry holding a prominent place.

A major achievement of the congress’s preparatory committees and commissions was the organization of scientific expeditions aimed at collecting exhibits for the upcoming display. These expeditions surveyed significant portions of Kharkiv province, producing valuable observations on folk life, including the attire of local residents. The ethnographic commission of the Kharkiv Preliminary Committee also called on the general public, including teachers and priests, to contribute samples of traditional clothing and other folk artifacts.

The exhibits from the 12th Archaeological Congress later formed the core collection of the Ethnographic Museum at the Kharkiv Imperial University. In 1920, they were transferred to the Ethnographic Department of the newly established Museum of Sloboda Ukraine, named after Hryhorii Skovoroda (later the Kharkiv Historical Museum). This collection remains a key resource for studying the region’s traditional costume.

In 1918, Mykola Sumtsov published his seminal historical and ethnographic work, *Slobozhany*, which included a chapter on the traditional clothing of the region and the changes it underwent during the 17th and 18th centuries. Other noteworthy studies include Vera Biletska’s *Embroidered Sheepskin Coats in the Bohodukhiv District of Kharkiv Region* and *Ukrainian Shirts: Their Types, Evolution, and Ornamentation*.
 
### Development and Challenges in the Study of Traditional Costumes of Sloboda Ukraine
By the 1930s, research into the traditional folk costume of Sloboda Ukraine had essentially ceased, and it was not until the second half of the 20th century that interest in this area was rekindled. Despite the challenges faced by ethnographic science during the Soviet era, primarily due to ideological constraints, several notable works emerged during this period. These works remain exemplary for subsequent generations of researchers.

A new phase in the study of traditional costumes began with Ukraine's independence in 1991, accompanied by a growing interest in the ethnic cultures of Ukrainians and national minorities. A number of specialized publications on this aspect of material culture gained significant public attention, elevating academic discussions to a qualitatively new level. However, given the general nature of these studies, the traditional clothing of Sloboda Ukraine received insufficient attention. In some cases, the lack of reliable information was compensated for by subjective interpretations. Attempts to reconstruct full costume ensembles have also been problematic, as the collections in central museums—often the primary sources for researchers—are incomplete, and the attribution of individual artifacts is not always reliable.

The gradual revival of ethnological studies at the local level began in Kharkiv in the late 1980s. A milestone in this process was the organization of several field research projects, including the comprehensive folklore and ethnographic expedition *Muravsky Shlyakh*. Over the course of several years, participants surveyed large parts of Kharkiv Oblast and some settlements in neighboring Poltava. Although traditional clothing was not the primary focus of these studies, ethnographers succeeded in uncovering valuable information about its production and use, as well as photographing individual elements.

A major outcome of this long-term expeditionary work was the publication of *The Clothing of Ukrainians in Slobozhanshchyna in the 20th Century: Based on Materials from the Folk Folklore-Ethnographic Collective “Verbichenka” of the Novovodolazky Center for Children and Youth Creativity in 2017*. This publication marked a significant increase in interest in traditional Sloboda Ukrainian costumes, both among professional ethnographers and the general public. However, despite these achievements, substantial progress in this area remains elusive. One of the main limiting factors is the scarcity of source material—a challenge that the Traditional Folk Costume of Kharkiv Oblast project aims to address.
